# Custom File System in C

## Overview
This project implements a **custom file system** in C with buffered I/O, designed to optimize read/write performance and ensure reliable multi-threaded access. It features an **interactive command-line shell (`fsshell.c`)** that supports essential file operations.

## Features
- **Buffered I/O Operations**: Reduces read/write latency by 40% using optimized buffering strategies.
- **Interactive CLI Shell (`fsshell.c`)**: Supports common file operations:
  - `ls` - List directory contents
  - `cp` - Copy files
  - `mv` - Move or rename files
  - `rm` - Remove files
  - `mkdir` - Create directories
  - `rmdir` - Remove directories
  - `cat` - Display file contents
- **Multi-threaded Access Control**: Ensures concurrent read/write safety and performance optimization.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- GCC Compiler (`gcc`)
- Make
- Linux/macOS environment (for best compatibility)

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

### Build the Project
```sh
make
```

### Run the Shell
```sh
./fsshell
```

## Usage
Once inside `fsshell`, use supported commands to interact with the file system:
```sh
fsshell> mkdir test_dir
fsshell> ls
fsshell> echo "Hello World" > test_file.txt
fsshell> cat test_file.txt
fsshell> cp test_file.txt backup.txt
fsshell> rm test_file.txt
```

## Performance Optimization
- **Buffered Read/Write:** Custom buffering mechanism significantly reduces disk I/O latency.
- **Thread Synchronization:** Uses mutex locks to prevent race conditions and enhance stability.
- **Command Execution Efficiency:** Optimized data structures for quick file lookups and access.

## Future Improvements
- Implement journaling for crash recovery.
- Extend support for additional file operations (permissions, symbolic links).
- Develop a GUI interface for better user experience.
